# UltraStrafe 
Have you ever wanted to airstrafe in Ultrakill just like in quake? 
Well now you can with UltraStrafe!
<br>
Physics equations are based off the Xonotic darkplaces engine: [link](https://github.com/xonotic/darkplaces/blob/55e56658cb6e7e68c8ed11da18eebd8241a58960/sv_user.c#L376-L395)

## Features
- Airstrafing 
- Bunnyhopping
- Customizable settings (including a tweak to the equation that makes airstrafing more suited for Ultrakill!)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add the ability to change the airstrafe equation to a custom one
- [ ] Allow the user to change the cvars from the console just like in the game
- [ ] Implement other types of air physics (like Quake 1, Source, etc.)
- [ ] Add a HUD that shows the optimal angle for airstrafing

Thanks to everyone in the ultrakill discord for any advice or help they gave!
##### This mod is still in development, and messes with physics, so expect bugs (please report them [here](https://github.com/10-days-till-xmas/UltraStrafe/issues)!!).
